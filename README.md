# Automated AI Art posting bot to Farcaster

This project automates the generation of AI art through OpenAI's DALL-E 3 and posts it to Farcaster using the Warpcast API. It leverages Python scripting to create visual content for good morning posts (just as a means to test out the process):

- Python
- OpenAI DALL-E 3
- Farcaster Warpcast API
- imgBB API
